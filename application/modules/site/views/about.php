                        <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        	In store look was established to improve connections between local business and their surrounding customer base through a localised online marketplace.
                            <br/>
                        	By allowing customers to search within a specified location like the current suburb, they can narrow down their search to specific stores, products and the nearest location.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                        	We believe that there is a need to increase customer awareness of the benefits of buying not only within Australia but within their local community and we strive to make this a common reality. Supporting communities through supporting local businesses.
